Feb 02: Trying to move a DC motor but burning boost convertor

Summary: 

- Goal: Use buck convertor to reduce voltage of lipo batter from 12V → 5V for the motor driver
- findings:
    - never had a 12V lipo battery, only a 7.4V and a 2.7V
    - buck convertor is actually just a boost converter, won’t bring voltage down below supply

Setup was motor driver hooked up to one DC motor with a 7.4V lipo battery hooked to the buck convertor as input.

We tried hooking up the buck convertor to the battery, which started off amping the voltage to 29V and then we continuously turned the knob to bring the voltage down and used a multimeter to measure along the way. However, once we hit 7.4V (which is how much we’re supplying), the voltage wouldn’t drop any further no matter how much we turned the knob

May have turned the knob too much, and pushed the converter to its limits because it soon sparked and caught fire. After that, we tried using the converter again but it seemed to have burned out permanently since it wouldn’t change input voltage anymore.
